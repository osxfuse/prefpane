// The KSUpdateCheckAction class checks for updates.  Its input consists of:
// - a KSServer which encapsulates the server communication;
// - an array of tickets, represting local installs which may need
//   updating; and
// - an optional fetcher factory which encapsulates a
//   request/response (e.g. loading of a URL request).
// All tickets must point to the same server URL.
//
// If there are updates to perform, the KSUpdateCheckAction will take
// the KSActions generated by its KSServer, presumably
// KSUpdateActions, and place them on it's own action processor.  This
// class will finish (call the KSActionProcessor's
// finishedProcessing:successfully:) when done deciding what to do,
// which may be before its "child" KSUpdateActions have completed.
//
// This class is the only interface that KSUpdateEngine will use for
// server communication.  It is expected that KSUpdateEngine will create a
// KSUpdateCheckAction for each unique server URL seen in a ticket
// store.
